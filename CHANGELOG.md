# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.8] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Startup regression**: The `start.sh`, `start-silent.sh`, `npm start`, `npm run dev`, and DXT manifest all launched `node server.mjs` directly, but since 1.3.6 `server.mjs` no longer auto-runs `main()` — only `bin/mcp-ssh.js` does. The server therefore exited immediately on startup for anyone not invoking the bin wrapper (including the shipped start scripts and DXT package). All entry points now call `node bin/mcp-ssh.js`.

## [1.3.7] - 2026-04-11

### Security
- Resolved all open `npm audit` advisories (4 high, 3 moderate) by bumping transitive dependencies. Seven GHSAs no longer reachable from this package:
  - `path-to-regexp` (prod, via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk → express → router`) — CVE-2024-45296 / CVE-2024-52798 DoS (not exploitable via our STDIO-only usage, fixed anyway).
  - `node-forge` — GHSA-2328-f5f3-gj25, GHSA-q67f-28xg-22rw, GHSA-5m6q-g25r-mvwx, GHSA-ppp5-5v6c-4jwp.
  - `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `brace-expansion` (dev, via vitest chain).
  - `picomatch`, `vite` (dev, via vitest chain) — required a `vitest`/`@vitest/coverage-v8` minor bump from 4.0.18 to 4.1.4.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` now reports zero vulnerabilities. CI workflow's security audit step is unchanged and continues to block on any future high-severity finding.

## [1.3.6] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Windows startup (fixes #8)**: The server silently exited when launched via `bin/mcp-ssh.js` on Windows MCP clients (e.g. Antigravity), causing a "failed to initialize: EOF" error. The cause was an `isMainModule` check in `server.mjs` that compared `process.argv[1]` against forward-slash path suffixes (`/mcp-ssh.js`), which never matched on Windows where `process.argv[1]` uses backslashes. The check has been removed entirely; `bin/mcp-ssh.js` now imports `main()` from `server.mjs` and calls it explicitly. Reported by @sdwru.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-04-11

### Security
- **SECURITY FIX (high)**: Fixed SSH `ProxyCommand` option-injection that allowed local RCE on the machine running the MCP server. A crafted `hostAlias` such as `-oProxyCommand=...` was passed to `ssh`/`scp` without an argument-terminator, so SSH interpreted it as an option and executed the attacker's command locally — bypassing the documented protection of `# @password:` annotations and exposing local SSH keys and credentials.
- **SECURITY FIX (high, Windows-only)**: Fixed a second local-RCE vector on Windows. `runRemoteCommand`, `uploadFile` and `downloadFile` previously used `spawn(..., { shell: true })` so that `ssh.exe`/`scp.exe` could be found via PATH. With `shell: true` every argument is re-parsed by `cmd.exe`, so shell metacharacters (`&`, `|`, `^`, `>`, `"`, `;`, etc.) in `hostAlias`, `command`, `localPath` or `remotePath` would have been interpreted by `cmd.exe` and could trigger arbitrary local command execution. The server now resolves `ssh.exe`/`scp.exe` to absolute paths once at startup (via PATH + PATHEXT walk) and uses `shell: false` everywhere.
- **Hardening**: Added a strict whitelist for `hostAlias` (`^[A-Za-z0-9_.@:][A-Za-z0-9._@:-]*$`). Rejects leading `-` (option injection) and all shell metacharacters (cmd.exe injection). Applied to `runRemoteCommand`, `uploadFile`, `downloadFile` (and transitively to `checkConnectivity` and `runCommandBatch`).
- **Hardening**: Added a known-host check (`_assertKnownHostAlias`) that requires every `hostAlias` to be defined in `~/.ssh/config` (including Include directives) or present in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. The LLM can no longer reach arbitrary hostnames the user has not explicitly configured — Whitelist instead of Blacklist.
- **Hardening**: Added `--` argument terminator to all `ssh`/`scp` invocations as defense in depth.
- **Fix**: Removed the hard-coded `DISPLAY=:0` value from the SSH askpass environment. It was a POSIX/X11 assumption that could break behavior on Windows; `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force` is sufficient on its own.
- **Fix**: `expandIncludePath()` now handles Windows drive-letter and UNC paths correctly (`path.isAbsolute` + `path.win32.isAbsolute`) and accepts `~\path` with a backslash separator.
- Added regression tests for the option-injection vector and shell-metacharacter vector across all five affected tools.
- Documented the tool's threat model and trust boundaries in `README.md` (`runRemoteCommand` is by-design remote RCE; `uploadFile`/`downloadFile` expose the local filesystem with the server process's privileges; recommend running under an unprivileged user or in a container).
- Reported by Pico (`piiiico` on GitHub) as part of an MCP server security audit. Thank you for the responsible disclosure.
